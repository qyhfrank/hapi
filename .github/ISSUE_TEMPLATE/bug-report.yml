        Thank you for submitting a bug report! It helps make HAPI better for everyone.

        If you need help or support using HAPI, and are not reporting a bug, please post on [HAPI/discussions](https://github.com/tiann/hapi/discussions), where you can ask questions or engage with others on ideas for how to improve HAPI.

        You are already an engineer who uses coding agents; you should know how to describe issues clearly. Issues that lack a clear description will be closed.

        Please try to include as much information as possible.
